Handlebar
=========

Handlebar is a fresh, new WordPress theme made for easy reading and focus on your content. It's 100% free and is built from the ground-up to look great on every device, browser, screen size. And yes, it comes with free support. I guess Handlebar is just my way of saying thanks to the open source community.
